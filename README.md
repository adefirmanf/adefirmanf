#### Hi hi! 
Hi! Thanks for dropping by my GitHub page. I’m Adefirman — just a regular guy who loves to explore new tools to make my workflow faster. Right now I using Neovim as my main editor, plus tmux to manage my sessions. Everything is also terminal-based.

Most of the time, I do finance projects, help the finance team save time, and do less manual work. Automate here, automate there — so they can relax a bit. I also got a bit of blockchain, not an expert, but understand enough to play around.

Sometimes I just like to try new tech, tweak things here and there, and see how to make it more efficient

#### Nerd Corner

#### A bit of personality
I have limited energy when interacting with people; Indonesian and love Americano a lot
