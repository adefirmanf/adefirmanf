#### Hi hi! 
Hi! Thanks for dropping by my GitHub page. I’m Adefirman — just a regular guy who loves to explore new tools to make my workflow faster. Right now I using Neovim as my main editor, plus tmux to manage my sessions. Everything is also terminal-based.

Most of the time, I do finance projects, help the finance team save time, and do less manual work.

#### Nerd Corner
Keycron K3 Wireless with Brown Switch (Main keyboard), MacBook Air M3, and Logitech MX Master 3S 

#### A bit of personality
I have limited energy when interacting with people; Indonesian and love Americano a lot
